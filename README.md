## About US rates
This list assumes you have an economic nexus (i.e. that you are obligated to collect sales tax on online purchases for all states that make online purchases taxable) in every US state. Note that this CSV assumes you are selling physical goods. Many states have different rules for services or digital goods.

Because the US rates are given per-state, this will in many cases underestimate taxes for US customers. For example, if an order is placed to an address in Alameda County, CA, the state rate of 7.25% will be applied. But Hayward and other cities in Alameda Country add their own sales taxes, resulting in rates as high as 10.75%. This gap is a trade-off for not subscribing to a service that tracks the ~36,000 actual rates across the US. Usually the difference between the state and local rates will be smaller than this, typically 0.5% to 1.5%; and in many cases, where municipalities donâ€™t add any tax of their own, that difference is zero.
