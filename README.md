## About US rates
This list assumes you have an economic nexus (i.e. that you are obligated to collect sales tax on online purchases for states that require it) in every US state.

Because the US rates are given per-state, this will in many cases underestimate taxes for US customers. For example, if an order is placed to Alameda County, CA, the state rate from is 7.25%. But Hayward and other cities in Alameda Country add their own sales taxes, resulting in rates as high as 10.75%. This oversimplification is a trade-off for not subscribing to a service that tracks the ~36,000 actual rates across the US. Usually the difference between these rates will be smaller than this, typically 0.5% to 1.5%; and in many cases, where municipalities donâ€™t add any tax of their own, that difference is zero.
